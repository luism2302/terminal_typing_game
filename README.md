# PyGame Typing Game
## Overview
See how many words you can type in a minute. Using the PyGame library, it displays a random word chosen from the [MIT's 10000 word list](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000). As the player types, the current typed word is shown on screen, when the typed word matches the word chosen from the list, another word is picked. This process repeats until the timer reaches 0.
